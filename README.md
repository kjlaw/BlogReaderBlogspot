Blog Reader App
===============

Modified Blog Reader app from Treehouse to work with a Blogger blog.

I followed a course on Treehouse to create a Blog Reader app. The Treehouse Blog Reader app was designed to display posts from the Treehouse blog. However, I also wanted to be able to read other blogs through the app, so I modified it to add a settings page.  In the settings, if you enter the name of a Blogger blog, you can view it on the app. I also modified the blog post list display within the app by gathering data about when the blog post was published and displaying that date alongside the blog post title.
